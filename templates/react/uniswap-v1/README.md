This project was bootstrapped with [Create Eth App](https://github.com/paulrberg/create-eth-app) and the [Uniswap v1 Template](https://github.com/PaulRBerg/create-eth-app/tree/develop/templates/uniswap).

This template contains two packages:

- [contracts](/packages/contracts)
- [react-app](/packages/react-app)

The React app implements a basic example for how to connect and pull data from the [Uniswap v1 subgraph](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/graphprotocol/uniswap).

## What is Uniswap?

Uniswap is a protocol for automated token exchange on Ethereum. Read more about it in the [official documentation](https://docs.uniswap.io/).

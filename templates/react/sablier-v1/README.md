This project was bootstrapped with [Create Eth App](https://github.com/paulrberg/create-eth-app) and the [Sablier v1 Template](https://github.com/paulrberg/create-eth-app/tree/develop/templates/sablier).

This template contains two packages:

- [contracts](/packages/contracts)
- [react-app](/packages/react-app)

The React app implements a basic example for how to connect and pull data from the [Sablier subgraph](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/sablierhq/sablier).

## What is Sablier?

Sablier is the protocol for real-time finance on the Ethereum blockchain. Just like you can stream movies on Netflix or music on Spotify, so you can stream money on Sablier. Read more about it in the [official documentation](https://docs.sablier.finance/).

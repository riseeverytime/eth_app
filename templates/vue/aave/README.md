This project was bootstrapped with [Create Eth App](https://github.com/paulrberg/create-eth-app) and the [Aave Template](https://github.com/paulrberg/create-eth-app/tree/develop/templates/vue/aave).

This template contains two packages:

- [contracts](/packages/contracts)
- [vue-app](/packages/vue-app)

The Vue app implements a basic example for how to connect and pull data from the [Aave subgraph](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/aave/protocol).

## What is Aave?

Aave is a decentralized non-custodial money market protocol where users can participate as depositors or borrowers. Read more about it in the [official documentation](https://developers.aave.com/).
